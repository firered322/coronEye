            <h1>What is COVID-19?</h1>
            <h4>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to
                more
                severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome
                (SARS-CoV).</h4>

            <h4>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously
                identified in humans.</h4>

            <h4>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed
                investigations
                found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to
                humans.
                Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. </h4>

            <h2>For Everyone</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Wash your hands frequently</h3>
                </li>
                <h4>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                    water.</h4>
                <h4>Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on
                    your hands.</h4>

                <li>
                    <h3>Maintain social distancing</h3>
                </li>
                <h4>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                </h4>
                <h4>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
                    contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus
                    if the person coughing has the disease.</h4>

                <li>
                    <h3>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h3>
                </li>
                <h4>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus
                    to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                </h4>

                    <h3>Practice respiratory hygiene</h3>
                </li>
                <h4>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
                    mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used
                    tissue immediately.</h4>
                <h4>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from
                    viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. </h4>
